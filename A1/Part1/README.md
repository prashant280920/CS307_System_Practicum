### Problem 1 - Creating a myshell
We have created myshell.

## Commands that the myshell support
1. clr
2. pause
3. help
4. quit/Ctrl+D
5. history
6. cd 'directory'
7. dir 'directory'
8. environ
9. echo 'comment'
10. The shell able to take its command line input from a file. That is, if the command line is invoked with command line argument: **myshell "batchfile"** then "batchfile" is assumed to contain a set of command lines for the shell to process. When the end of file is reached, the shell should exit.

## Running the file
1. Run command `make`. This will create a <myshell> exe file.
2. Now run the exe file `./myshell`. Now you can run the shell commands 
3. If you want to run batchfile. I have given a batchfile for testing. Just run `./myshell batchfile`.
