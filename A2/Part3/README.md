## Problem -3 Multithreaded MergeSort 

You need to implement Merge Sort using threads. The sorting should be in place and You will be
provided a file of 2GB data which you need to sort using the merge sort algorithm implemented.
You are free to allocate some additional memory to keep temporary data if needed.

### Running the file.
1. Run command `make`. This will create exe files named `q3`.
2. Now to create the <b>input.txt</b> file. Just run the `./script`. This will create the input.txt file that contain the unsorted array.
3. Now o run the q3 exe file. Run `./q3 <number of threads> input.txt output.txt`.
    For example - `./q3 8 input.txt output.txt`.
